                 increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)    
            </li>

            Exotic dance moves
        </h4>

        <p>
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To 
            answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chiken dance</dt>
            <dd>A little Known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole villege would dance around in a circle like 
                chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".          
            </dd>

            <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
            <dd>Befor the Icelanders developed fire as a means of gettin warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved hudding 
                close together in a circle on the floor, and shufflin their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements.
                One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking
            </dd>

            <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers 1960<sub>s</sub>believed to have discovered a new dance 
                style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Leter on 
                however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>Your sincerely,</p>
