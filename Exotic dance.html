         Exoticism is better approached through language facts than 
        hard facts. It is not unique to specific places, peoples, or
         objects but instead refers to a way of looking at and 
         discoursing about all three. It is a discursive formation 
         whereby the West constructs a geographic Other and thus its 
         identity. In all constructs of Otherness, the Subject
        (or the Self) stigmatizes a difference (geographic, in this
        case), essentializes it, and on the basis of that 
        essentialization, negates the identity of the Other.
        This process often legitimizes discrimination. Exoticism 
        is by nature asymmetrical: the Self (in here) has the
        power to name and place the Other (out there) but not
        the other way around. Exoticism is also reductive and
        deterministic as it essentializes difference and 
        relegates Otherness to a space from which the Other 
        derives its essential traits. The exotic, therefore,
        is the faraway, or rather, that which is far away 
        from us, typically warm, tropical countries. Europe, 
        for instance, would not be exotic to Peruvians or 
        Senegalese. That explains why in the past,
        “exotic products” stores sold goods from colonies
        and why today, expressions such as “exotic fruit”
        or “exotic wood” refer exclusively to tropical plants.
